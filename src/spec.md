# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Correct the landing page footer attribution text and remove an unintended heart icon while keeping the existing caffeine.ai link intact.

**Planned changes:**
- Change the footer attribution copy from "by Ishu" to exactly "by echu ❤️".
- Remove the heart icon currently displayed between the words "with" and "using" in "Built with … using caffeine.ai", without altering the caffeine.ai link URL/UTM parameters.

**User-visible outcome:** The landing page footer shows the updated attribution "by echu ❤️" and no longer displays a heart icon between “with” and “using”, while the caffeine.ai link remains unchanged.
